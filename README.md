# energy-level-diagram

A simple library to plot energy level diagrams using Matplotlib. It supports multiple columns of levels, optional automatic regulation of level spacing, and dashed connections between columns.

The `label` parameter sets the title of the diagram, and `plot()` now returns the
``matplotlib`` figure and axes objects for further customisation.

## Example scripts

The `examples` directory contains scripts demonstrating typical usage. You can run them directly with Python to see how the diagram API works.

```
python examples/basic_usage.py
python examples/vertical_arrow.py
```

These scripts create diagrams using different features of the library but do not display their resulting plots here.
